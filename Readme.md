# An overview: Gradient-based Optimization

This repository includes my codes for running and reviewing the effects of different gradient-based optimization approaches on MNIST and CIFAR datasets.

For the results, you can use tensorboard:

```
tensorboard --logdir='./runs'
```

I have used tensorboardX to bind it with PyTorch.

The accuracies and a more detailed report can also be found in this repository.
